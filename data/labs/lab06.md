#Lab #6 - Building Out Our TODO List Manager
COMP4711 - BCIT - Fall 2017

##Lab Goals

The purpose of this lab is to "build out" our TODO list webapp
from last lab,
by adding some role-based CRUD and making the list more functional.

The lab will build on the last one (lab 5). If your lab 5 has issues,
they should be fixed before starting this lab.

We will continue to use gitflow workflow. That means proper branching (master/develop), 
completing new work in feature branches, and good commit comments.

##Lab Teams & Repo

Use the same "Lab 5" team as for the last lab.

##Lab Submission

Your lab will result in an updated github repository for your team.

Submit a readme *text* file, or a submission comment, to the lab dropbox. 
It should contain a link to your **team**'s github repository. 

Note: this is not a cloning URL, and I do not need links to the individual
team member repos.

Due: this Sunday at 17:30.

##Lab Marking Guideline

A marking rubric will be attached to the lab 6 dropboxes, similar to our
earlier labs. The labs will be weighted equally in the marks worksheet,
even if some of them have different raw scores because of their rubric.

##Process

We will continue to use gitflow workflow. That means proper branching (master/develop, 
with "develop" merged into "master" just before completion and submission),
completing new work in feature branches (which are throwaway branches, named
"feature/xxx" and merged into "develop" once acceptable), and good commit comments
(to provide a sense of what was done, from looking at the commit history).

You should already have a team and repo, with suitable roles for the team
members. I don't think you need more direction on this :-/

##Github repository

In your github repo, make sure that everything has been merged into your
*master* branch before starting this lab, so that your *develop* branch
is "clean". 

##Your jobs

There are seven small jobs to do to complete the lab. I suggest that you switch
team members for each.

- [Job 4 - Maintenance list](/display/tutorial/ci-todo04)
- [Job 6 - Pagination](/display/tutorial/ci-todo06)
- [Job 7 - User roles](/display/tutorial/ci-todo07)
- [Job 10 - Add "completion" to the Homepage](/display/tutorial/ci-todo10)
- [Job 11 - Beef up the maintenance page](/display/tutorial/ci-todo11)
- [Job 12 - Add item maintenance (finally)](/display/tutorial/ci-todo12)
- [Job 11b - Polish the item maintenance](/display/tutorial/ci-todo11b)

Yes, the job #'s seem strange, but they carry on from lab 5 :-/

#Wrapup

<div class="alert alert-info">
Captain: assuming that everyone on the team agrees that
you have completed the lab, prepare for submission.

It is now time
to merge the develop branch into the master branch,
and submit a link to the dropbox!!
