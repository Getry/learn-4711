#Lab #6 - Building Out Our TODO List
COMP4711 - BCIT - Winter 2017

##Lab Goals

The purpose of this lab is to "build out" our TODO list webapp
from last lab,
by adding some role-based CRUD and making the list functional.

The lab will build on the last one (lab 5). If your lab 5 is good, then continue 
to use it. If you are not happy with it, you may use the
[TODO 2 starter](https://github.com/jedi-academy/starter-todo2), 
which is the state yours should have ended up in last week.

We will continue to use gitflow workflow. That means proper branching (master/develop), 
completing new work in feature branches, and good commit comments.

##Lab Teams & Repo

Use the same "Lab 5" team as for the last lab, unless you were a team of one.
If the latter applies, you need to find a classmate who did not join
a team for the last lab, or combine with an existing team of two.
See me in lab if this applies to you.

##Lab Submission

Your lab will result in an updated github repository for your team.

Submit a readme *text* file, or a submission comment, to the lab dropbox. 
It should contain a link to your **team**'s github repository. 

Note: this is not a cloning URL, and I do not need links to the individual
team member repos.

Due: in theory, this should be completed during the lab period,
but some teams will need a bit more time.  
I have set the deadline to this Sunday at 17:30.

##Lab Marking Guideline

A marking rubric will be attached to the lab 6 dropboxes, similar to our
earlier labs. The labs will be weighted equally in the marks worksheet,
even if some of them have different raw scores because of their rubric.

##Process

You should already have a team and repo, with suitable roles for the team
members. I don't think you need more direction on this :-/

Make sure that you **merge your develop branch into your master** at the end of the lab.

##Github repository

In your github repo, make sure that everything has been merged into your
*master* branch before starting this lab, so that your *develop* branch
is "clean".

##Your jobs

There are four jobs to do to complete the lab. I suggest that you switch
team members for each.

- [Job 4 - Maintenance list](/display/tutorial/ci-todo4)
- [Job 6 - Pagination](/display/tutorial/ci-todo6)
- [Job 7 - User roles](/display/tutorial/ci-todo07)
- [Job 8 - Item maintenance](/display/tutorial/ci-todo08)

Yes, the job #'s seem strange, but they carry on from lab 5 :-/

#Wrapup

<div class="alert alert-info">
Captain: assuming that everyone on the team agrees that
you have completed the lab, prepare for submission.

Make a SQL dump of your database, with the option to drop any existing
tables. Put that in the <code>data</code> folder of your
project, and delete the original starter SQL from that folder.

It is now time
to merge the develop branch into the master branch,
and submit a link to the dropbox!!
