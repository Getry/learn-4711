**Week 10** *(Mon Mar 13, 13:30)*

**Assignment 2** *(Mon Mar 20, 14:30)*

**Deployment Server** *(Thu Mar 9, 23:00)*  
- The [test deployment server](http://deployer.jlparry.com/) seems to be working well.
- I am currently enhancing the deployment to include database setup from your SQL script
- Usage: see the ["Webhooks" writeup](/display/lesson/webhooks) 

**Labs** *(Tue Mar 14, 07:00)*  
- Assignment 1 marking is in progress; will resume next week
- Lab 5 marking is in the queue.
- Lab 6 marking is in the queue.

**Important**  
Some of you have been deleting your team repos or organizations as you move
forward through labs. This is not a good practice, until you have
received the lab/assignment feedback for them, as the repos need to
be accessible for me to check them!
