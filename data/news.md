**Week 13** (Tue 15:30)  
My topic this week is "authentication", but I am
redoing my earlier material to make more sense.
It won't be ready in a timely enough manner for
a survey, so you are off the hook this week :-/

The new material won't be posted until I am "happy"
with it, which I expect to be later Tues evening.
