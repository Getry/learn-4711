**Week 11** *(Sat Mar 25, 11:45)*  
- Sorry, but the week 11 reading will be late ... probably not ready
until Sunday evening. The topic is complicated, and I am struggling
with making it suitably simple, for our purposes.

**Assignment 2** *(Sat Mar 25, 11:45)*
- The PRc services have been implemented :)
- The [server-test]() app is in place, but it is having issues
connecting to the PRC server running on the same box, in a different
sub-domain. If you want to play with it, you will have to download
and run it from your system (after adjusting the config/database.php for your
system).
- Assignment 1 has been reviewed with each team, with suggestions.
At some point over the weekend, I plan to go through the
repositories and review your process. At that point, I can complete and publish the
dropbox feedback.

**Deployment Server** *(Sat Mar 25, 11:45)*  
- The [test deployment server](http://deployer.jlparry.com/) seems to be sorta working.
I need to tweak the deployment script so that it recreates your deployment folder,
rather than just trying to "git pull" into it & update it.
- I am currently enhancing the deployment to include database setup from your SQL script
- Usage: see the ["Webhooks" writeup](/display/lesson/webhooks) 

**Labs** *(Sat Mar 25, 11:45)*  
- Assignment 1 marking is in progress ... process review in progress, before publishing
- Lab 5 marking is in the queue.
- Lab 6 marking is in the queue.
- Lab 7 marking is in the queue.

**Important**  
Some of you have been deleting your team repos or organizations as you move
forward through labs. This is not a good practice, until you have
received the lab/assignment feedback for them, as the repos need to
be accessible for me to check them!
