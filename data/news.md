**Week 6** *(Wed Feb 15, 09:30)*  
- Today's presentation updated
- deployment testing looking good, finally - now for a web interface for you
- Lab 5 is up, and "Job 3" for it has been fixed :)

**OH NO** My Job3 tutorial has Bootstrap 3 styling, but my starter comes with Bootstrap 2.
That is why my two ordered columns do not show up side-by-side.

In `template_secondary.php`, replace `<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">` with `<div class="span6">` for the left and right side fragments.

I will update the tutorial later this evening.

**Labs** *(Thu Feb 16, 01:15)*  
- Lab 2 marking completed.  
- Lab 3 marking is in in progress
- Lab 4 marking is in the queue.
- Assignment 1 is in the queue.
