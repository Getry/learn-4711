**Week 11** (Tue 23:15)  
This week's lesson is posted. There is no survey for it.

Working on this week's lab.

**Assignment 2** (Fri 15:30)
- I have started a FAQ for the assignment - see section 17 in the organizer
- Added some travis-ci links in the devops FAQ
- I have vetted the assignment writeup, and added such
clarifications as I felt were warranted.
- The assignment has four main jobs, and teams of four or five -
sounds like a good match to me :)
