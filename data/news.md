**Week 10** *(Tue Mar 21, 02:00)*  
- Week 10 readings posted
- No lab in week 10 - work on assignment 2

**Assignment 2** *(Thu Mar 23, 09:30)*
- Assignment published; PRC services being tested. See the sidebar
- Added a note to the assignment writeup asking you to refer
to the online API guide, which I am in the process
of revising for clarity and completeness!
- I am also adding more points to the Assignment 2 FAQ, based on
observations from assignment 1.

**Deployment Server** *(Thu Mar 9, 23:00)*  
- The [test deployment server](http://deployer.jlparry.com/) seems to be working well.
- I am currently enhancing the deployment to include database setup from your SQL script
- Usage: see the ["Webhooks" writeup](/display/lesson/webhooks) 

**Labs** *(Thu Mar 23, 09:30)*  
- Assignment 1 marking is in progress ... reviewing features with teams in lab,
still have one more pass for "process" (repo) items before publishing
- Lab 5 marking is in the queue.
- Lab 6 marking is in the queue.
- Lab 7 marking is in the queue.

**Important**  
Some of you have been deleting your team repos or organizations as you move
forward through labs. This is not a good practice, until you have
received the lab/assignment feedback for them, as the repos need to
be accessible for me to check them!
