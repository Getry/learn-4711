**Lab 1 rubric :(**  
A little hiccup with the lab 1 rubric was uncovered - I got the points wrong :(
It was 0/1/3/4 and should hae been 0/1/2/3.

We have handled this as best we can, but it means that the feedback / grade
isn't quite as proper as I would have liked :-/

**Week 2** (Mon 11:30)  
- posted lab 2
- general FAQ updated, with link to CIT GitLab server
- added github integration
- lessons & survey ready
- survey closes 9pm Tue, to give me time to react
- Apache FAQ updated; Mac FAQ added

Course hub updates will be posted on https://comp4711.slack.com, which you
can join with a my.bcit.ca email address.
