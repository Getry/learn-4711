**Deployment Server** *(Fri Mar 3, 13:00)*  
- The [test deployment server](http://umbrella.jlparry.com/) seems to be working well.; 
15 of the teams have configured their webapp on it, at the time this was written.  
The "plants" page is there now - you can get a feel for what some of your
classmates are up to.  
I continue to chip away at this, as time permits.
I have added a ["Webhooks" writeup](/display/lesson/webhooks) 
in the "Reference" section of the course hub organizer,
for any who need help with setting up their webhook.

- Lab 4 marking is in the queue.
