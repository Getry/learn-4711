**Week 8** *(Tue Feb 28, 14:15)*  
- Forms presentation(s) posted. 
- Surveys processed, and presentations updated.
- Lab 6 posted, and refined.

- Lab 6 note: SQL dump not needed, as no DB changes were made this lab.
This is the last alert message in the lab 6 writeup.
I cannot change the rubric, as it is already in use, but you will not be
penalized for not doing a SQL dump.

**Deployment Server** *(Tue Feb 28, 16:20)*  
The deployment server is ready, though there may be bugs :-/  
I have sent emails to each of the team captains who requested
a token.  
Of course, if you sent me your request using D2L email, which
I previously warned you would not work, then you will have not
received my reply :(

I have added a ["Webhooks" writeup](/display/lesson/webhooks) 
in the "Reference" section of the course hub organizer.


**Labs** *(Thu Feb 16, 01:15)*  
- Lab 3 marking is in in progress
- Lab 4 marking is in the queue.
- Assignment 1 is in the queue.
