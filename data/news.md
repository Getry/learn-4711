**Assignment 2** (Wed 01:30)
- Added some travis-ci links in the devops FAQ
- I have vetted the assignment writeup, and added such
clarifications as I felt were warranted.
- The assignment has four main jobs, and teams of four or five -
sounds like a good match to me :)

**Week 10** (Tue 16:30)
- XML materials posted
- I encourage you to read the two presentations, but am not
going to do a survey about them - I think my in-class
presentation will be more helpful
- there are some more detailed presentations in the 
"Supplementary reading" section at the bottom of the organizer
- no "lab" this week - you are working on assignment 2
