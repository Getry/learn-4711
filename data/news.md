**Week 13** (Fri 11:15)  
Finally nailed the PUT parameter passing (thank you Yudhvir).
I have updated the package-restful repo, and added some
"danger" alerts to the tutorials for this lab.

The above will fix the multipart/formdata encoding that some of your
were seeing when you tried to update a todo item.

Oops - ooops - had to fix the fix. sorry!
Oops - fixed missing load() code in client-side tutorial step 5.

You've got lab :)
I removed the authentication part I had planned - I will make that available as
a demo instead of for marks.

I am "happy" with my "authentication" topic, and look forward
to making you think in class!!
