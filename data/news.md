**Week 12** *(Tue Apr 4, 13:15)*  
- Lesson posted. 
- Example repos mostly ready
- Added some REST examples from other frameworks, as part of "week 17"

**Assignment 2** *(Sat Apr 1, 15:40)*
- Assignment 2 FAQ updated (not an April Fool's joke)
- The [server-test](https://github.com/jim-parry/server-test) app is in place, but it is having issues
connecting to the PRC server running on the same box, in a different
sub-domain. If you want to play with it, you will have to download
and run it from your system (after adjusting the config/database.php for your
system).

**Assignment 3** *(Thu Apr 6, 11:30)*  

I do not plan to post a third assignment - I don't see that your learning or
sanity would be positively affected by it.

Something I am seeing with this week's lab is more of a "copy/paste/pray"
strategy, with many of the resulting issues resolvable by reading
and absorbing the writeup, the `restful` package readme, and/or the
example "ferries" repos that I showed in class.

I plan to review assignment 2 in lab next week, with each of the teams.

If any teams or individuals would like to pursue the originally planned
assignment 3, on an optional basis, let me know!

**Deployment Server** *(Sat Mar 25, 11:45)*  
- The [test deployment server](http://deployer.jlparry.com/) seems to be sorta working.
I need to tweak the deployment script so that it recreates your deployment folder,
rather than just trying to "git pull" into it & update it.
- I am currently enhancing the deployment to include database setup from your SQL script
- Usage: see the ["Webhooks" writeup](/display/lesson/webhooks) 

**Labs** *(Thu Apr 6, 11:30)*  
- Assignment 2 marking is in progress.
- Lab 6 marking is in the queue.
- Lab 7 marking is in the queue.
