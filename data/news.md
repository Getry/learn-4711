**Week 13** (Thu 14:10)  
Oops - ooops - had to fix the fix. sorry!
Oops - fixed missing load() code in client-side tutorial step 5.

You've got lab :)
I removed the authentication part I had planned - I will make that available as
a demo instead of for marks.

I am "happy" with my "authentication" topic, and look forward
to making you think in class!!
