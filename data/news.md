**Week 11** *(Tue Mar 28, 11:45)*  
- I have today's presentation. There are some slides that I plan to talk
to, to explain the problems we face.  
No survey this week _-/

**Assignment 2** *(Mon Mar 27, 12:30)*
- The PRC services have been implemented :) I have updated the assignment 2
writeup to reflect the changed endpoints.
- The [server-test](https://github.com/jim-parry/server-test) app is in place, but it is having issues
connecting to the PRC server running on the same box, in a different
sub-domain. If you want to play with it, you will have to download
and run it from your system (after adjusting the config/database.php for your
system).

**Deployment Server** *(Sat Mar 25, 11:45)*  
- The [test deployment server](http://deployer.jlparry.com/) seems to be sorta working.
I need to tweak the deployment script so that it recreates your deployment folder,
rather than just trying to "git pull" into it & update it.
- I am currently enhancing the deployment to include database setup from your SQL script
- Usage: see the ["Webhooks" writeup](/display/lesson/webhooks) 

**Labs** *(Wed Mar 29, 12:00)*  
- Assignment 1 marking completed
- Lab 5 marking is in progress.
- Lab 6 marking is in the queue.
- Lab 7 marking is in the queue.

**Important**  
Some of you have been deleting your team repos or organizations as you move
forward through labs. This is not a good practice, until you have
received the lab/assignment feedback for them, as the repos need to
be accessible for me to check them!
