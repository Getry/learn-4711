**Week 13** *(Mon Apr 10, 08:30)*  
No online reading for this week.  

I have posted a [survey](https://learn.bcit.ca//d2l/lms/survey/user/attempt/survey_start_frame.d2l?si=266881&ou=360899)
though, open until Thursday morning.
It asks for any questions you would like addressed during the review
lecture, as well as for your opinion about the course hub
and "flipped learning".  

I will do my best to answer or address any review questions
submitted before midnight tonight (Monday), either in the
survey results or in class.

I will be reviewing assignment 2 with each team during lab this week, and
you will have the opportunity to complete course evaluations.

**Assignment 3** *(Mon Apr 10, 08:30)*  

I do not plan to post a third assignment - I don't see that your learning or
sanity would be positively affected by it.

No one has asked to pursue an optional assignment 3.

**Labs** *(Mon Apr 10, 08:30)*  
- Assignment 2 marking is in progress.
- Lab 6 marking is in progress.
- Lab 7 marking is in the queue.
- Lab 8 marking is in the queue.
