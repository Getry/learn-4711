#Week 2 Survey Results

Responses for the survey follow, with the number of similar responses shown to the right of a response.	
	
I have interpreted and aggregated some of the results, in hopefully an appropriate fashion.
I will address some of the questions here, while others will be addressed in lecture or in lab.
My responses are in italics below.

There were 38 responders, with some good and some challenging questions. Thank you to those who responded :)
