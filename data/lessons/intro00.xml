    <slide title="Flipped Learning" layout="normal">
        <p>Weekly readings will be assigned, starting with the second week, 
            following somewhat of a "flipped" learning model. </p> 
        <p>You are to read these lessons and answer a D2L survey, 
            by the evening before that week's lecture. 
            This gives me a chance to adjust the lecture, 
            and to address issues important to you.
        </p>
        <p>This is not a fully "flipped" model, which would have the lectures
            totally online, and which would have face-to-face sessions be seminars only.</p>

    <slide title="Flipped LMS" layout="normal">
        <p>Desire2Learn (D2L) is a very comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS).</p>
        <p>It is both flexible and inflexible at the same time, and expects content
            to be re-expressed inside its awkward &amp; clunky confines.</p>
        <p>A flipped LMS, on the other hand, lives independently of D2L, and is
            whatever suits the tech-savvyness of the instructor. These are typically
            open-source, flat file driven, and stored/collaborated on, using
            an online repository.</p>
